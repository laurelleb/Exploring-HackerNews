# Exploring-HackerNews
by Laurelle B
Hacker News is a popular technology website which allows users to share their questions and projects with the world. In this specific project, I shall analyze "Ask HN" psosts and "Show HN" posts to discover:

- which section of the HN forums have the most activity and
- which time is the best to attract the most comments to a post.

The dataset for this project can be found (https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). I will be working with a small portion of the data because the original dataset contains 300,000 rows. The version of the dataset used in this project contains 20,000 rows - a result of removing posts with no comments - which I also think suggests something interesting. From there, a random sample of the remaining submissions from the 2016 dataset was finalizedled by Dataquest and posted to Kaggle.com.

My key learning objectives for this project are:

- filtering 
- data exploration
