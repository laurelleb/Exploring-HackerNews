    "# Exploration and Analysis of *Hacker News* Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hacker News* is a popular technology website which allows users to share their questions and projects with the world. In this specific project, I shall analyze \"Ask HN\" psosts and \"Show HN\" posts to discover:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - which section of the HN forums have the most activity and\n",
    "    - which time is the best to attract the most comments to a post.\n",
    " \n",
    "The dataset for this project can be found [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). I will be working with a small portion of the data because the original dataset contains 300,000 rows. The version of the dataset used in this project contains 20,000 rows - a result of removing posts with no comments - which I also think suggests something interesting. From there, a random sample of the remaining submissions from the 2016 dataset was finalizedled by Dataquest and posted to Kaggle.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "My key learning objectives for this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - filtering\n",
    "    - and working with datetime objects\n",
    "    \n",
    "I begin by opening the file and removeing the header row to ease manipulation of the dataset."

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based upon the results from the average number of comments by hour, posters either add a comment in the afternoon, night or early morning. The top average number of comments seem to occur at 15:00 EST during work hours. This suggests that people take a peek at the HN site towards the end of the traditional work day. People might comment on a post to take a break. The same could be said for 16:00 EST. An hour before the end of the workday, people tend to be more distracted. The other top hours to post a comment are outside of traditional working hours. Additionally, the times are after common dinner times or after a child’s bedtime. People pop into the \"Ask HN\" forum after completing the days tasks. Again, these comments are posted at times when people have a lull in their day. I find it interesting that the 2:00 EST time has one of the top five most comments per post. This suggests a few things, some people are staying up late, waking up early, or most reasonably, people from other parts of the world are starting or ending their days and have the time to post a comment. Hence, the importance of converting to different time zones.\n",
